# Research: Anyrand Frontend Application

**Date**: 2025-09-20
**Research Phase**: Phase 0 - Technology Stack Analysis

## Reference Project Architecture Analysis

### Decision: Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript Stack
**Rationale**: The lottopgf-v1-frontend reference project demonstrates proven patterns for Web3 applications using the latest stable versions of Next.js and React with excellent TypeScript integration.

**Key Architectural Patterns Identified**:
- **App Router Structure**: Next.js 15 App Router with proper SSR support
- **Component Organization**: Feature-based organization with UI/business logic separation
- **Container Pattern**: Page-level containers orchestrating multiple components
- **Suspense Integration**: Modern loading states with React Suspense

**Alternatives Considered**: Vite + React, but Next.js provides better SSR support for Web3 applications and built-in optimizations.

### Decision: Reown AppKit 1.6.2 for Wallet Integration
**Rationale**: Reference project shows successful implementation with excellent multi-wallet support, reduced bundle size, and enhanced performance in recent versions.

**Implementation Pattern**:
```typescript
export const wagmiAdapter = new WagmiAdapter({
  networks: [base, scroll, mainnet],
  projectId,
  ssr: true,
  storage: createStorage({ storage: cookieStorage }),
});
```

**Alternatives Considered**: Direct WalletConnect v2, but AppKit provides better UX and maintains compatibility.

### Decision: Wagmi 2.14.6 + Viem 2.21.57 for Blockchain Interactions
**Rationale**: Modern hooks-based approach with excellent TypeScript support, efficient caching, and built-in error handling.

**Key Patterns**:
- Suspense queries for better loading states
- Contract simulation before execution
- Optimized RPC batching with multicall
- Built-in retry logic and error handling

**Alternatives Considered**: Direct ethers.js integration, but Wagmi provides better React integration and caching.

## Anyrand Smart Contract Integration

### Decision: TypeScript Contract Interfaces with Event Monitoring
**Rationale**: Analysis shows Anyrand requires complex transaction flows with real-time event monitoring for request tracking and fulfillment.

**Core Integration Patterns**:
- **Request Flow**: `getRequestPrice()` → `requestRandomness()` → event monitoring
- **Fulfillment Flow**: Event listening → `fulfillRandomness()` → callback verification
- **State Management**: Real-time request state tracking with `getRequestState()`

**Key Contract Functions**:
```typescript
interface AnyrandIntegration {
  requestRandomness(deadline: number, callbackGasLimit: number): Promise<RequestResult>;
  getRequestPrice(callbackGasLimit: number): Promise<PriceInfo>;
  getRequestState(requestId: bigint): Promise<RequestState>;
  fulfillRandomness(requestId: bigint, ...params): Promise<FulfillmentResult>;
}
```

**Multi-Network Support**:
- Scroll (mainnet): 0x7ED45287f817842d72753FE02617629c4c7c2FBE
- Scroll Sepolia: 0xdFB68D4a5703bC99bEe0A8eb48fA12aBF1280aaC
- Base: 0xF6baf607AC2971EE6A3C47981E7176134628e36C

**Alternatives Considered**: GraphQL subgraph integration, but direct contract interaction provides better real-time updates.

## State Management Strategy

### Decision: TanStack Query 5.62.10 with Optimized Caching
**Rationale**: Blockchain data requires sophisticated caching strategies due to network latency and gas costs. React Query provides excellent patterns for this.

**Caching Strategy**:
```typescript
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 30_000, // 30 seconds for blockchain data
      gcTime: 5 * 60_000, // 5 minutes garbage collection
      retry: (failureCount, error) => {
        if (error.message?.includes('User rejected')) return false;
        return failureCount < 3;
      },
    },
  },
});
```

**Query Patterns**:
- Suspense hooks for contract reads
- Dependent queries for complex data fetching
- Real-time invalidation on transaction confirmation
- Batched contract calls with multicall

**Alternatives Considered**: Zustand + SWR, but React Query provides better blockchain-specific patterns.

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright
**Rationale**: Modern testing stack with excellent TypeScript support and blockchain-specific testing capabilities.

**Testing Approach**:
- **Unit Tests**: Component and hook testing with mocked blockchain interactions
- **Integration Tests**: User flow testing with simulated wallet connections
- **E2E Tests**: Full blockchain interactions with local Hardhat network
- **Performance Tests**: Large data set rendering and memory leak prevention

**Mock Strategy**:
```typescript
// Wallet mocking for consistent testing
export const createMockWallet = () => ({
  request: vi.fn(),
  selectedAddress: '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890',
  chainId: '0x1',
  isMetaMask: true,
});

// Contract mocking for predictable test results
export const createMockAnyrandContract = () => ({
  requestRandomness: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ hash: '0xabc123' }),
  getRequestPrice: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(['1000000000000000', '20000000000']),
});
```

**Alternatives Considered**: Jest, but Vitest provides better ES modules support and faster execution.

## UI Component Strategy

### Decision: Radix UI + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
**Rationale**: Reference project demonstrates excellent accessibility, consistent theming, and developer experience with this combination.

**Component Patterns**:
- Variant-based styling with `class-variance-authority`
- Composition over inheritance with Radix primitives
- CSS variables for consistent theming
- Responsive design with Tailwind utilities

**Key Components Needed**:
- WalletConnect button with status display
- Transaction forms with validation
- Real-time status cards with loading states
- Data tables with sorting and filtering
- Error boundaries with recovery actions

**Alternatives Considered**: Material-UI, but Radix provides better accessibility and customization.

## Performance Optimization

### Decision: Next.js Built-in Optimizations + Custom Blockchain Patterns
**Rationale**: Blockchain applications have unique performance challenges requiring specialized optimization strategies.

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Code splitting by feature/route
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Bundle analysis and tree shaking
- RPC request batching and caching
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Memory leak prevention for event listeners

**Monitoring Approach**:
- Bundle size tracking
- Performance metrics for blockchain operations
- Memory usage monitoring
- User interaction analytics

**Alternatives Considered**: Webpack manual configuration, but Next.js provides better defaults.

## Security Considerations

### Decision: Defense-in-Depth Security Strategy
**Rationale**: Frontend blockchain applications require multiple layers of security due to financial implications.

**Security Measures**:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure wallet connection patterns
- Environment variable protection
- XSS prevention with proper escaping
- HTTPS enforcement for production
- No private key exposure in client code

**Error Handling**:
```typescript
export function extractErrorMessages(error: unknown): BlockchainError {
  // Comprehensive error classification and user-friendly messaging
  if (error.message?.includes('User rejected')) {
    return { type: 'USER_REJECTED', message: 'Transaction was rejected' };
  }
  // Additional error types...
}
```

**Alternatives Considered**: Basic validation only, but comprehensive security is essential for financial applications.

## Development Workflow

### Decision: ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript Strict Mode
**Rationale**: Ensures code quality and consistency across the team while preventing common blockchain development errors.

**Quality Tools**:
- TypeScript strict configuration with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`
- ESLint with React and blockchain-specific rules
- Prettier with Tailwind plugin for formatting
- Pre-commit hooks for automated quality checks

**Build Process**:
- Development with Turbopack for faster iteration
- Production builds with optimization
- Environment-specific configuration
- Automated deployment pipeline

**Alternatives Considered**: Minimal tooling, but comprehensive quality tools prevent expensive mistakes in blockchain development.
