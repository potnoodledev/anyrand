# Feature Specification: Anyrand Frontend Application - Phase 1: Wallet Authentication

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-frontend`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft - Phase 1 Focus
**Input**: User description: "build a frontend application for the underlying anyrand contracts. allow the user to login with a wallet and request randomness and fulfill pending requests. also show details about the previously done randomness request transactions and the resulting randomness"
**Phase 1 Focus**: Implement WalletConnect/Reown authentication only, establishing the foundation for future smart contract interactions

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A crypto user visits the Anyrand frontend application to establish wallet authentication. They connect their wallet using WalletConnect/Reown protocol to establish a secure session. Once authenticated, the interface displays their connected wallet address and network information, providing the foundation for future smart contract interactions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the application without a connected wallet, **When** they click "Connect Wallet", **Then** they see a WalletConnect/Reown QR code or deep link options for wallet connection
2. **Given** a user has scanned the QR code or clicked a deep link, **When** they approve the connection in their wallet app, **Then** the application displays their connected wallet address and current network
3. **Given** a user has an active wallet session, **When** they refresh the page or return later, **Then** the session persists and they remain authenticated
4. **Given** a connected user, **When** they click "Disconnect Wallet", **Then** the session is terminated and they return to the unauthenticated state
5. **Given** a user switches networks in their wallet, **When** the network change is detected, **Then** the application updates to show the new network information
6. **Given** a user switches accounts in their wallet, **When** the account change is detected, **Then** the application updates to show the new account address

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the WalletConnect/Reown connection times out during pairing?
- How does the system handle when a user rejects the connection request in their wallet?
- What occurs when the wallet app is closed or unavailable during an active session?
- How are connection errors and network issues communicated to users?
- What happens when a user tries to connect with an unsupported wallet?
- How does the system handle session expiration and reconnection?

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Wallet Session**: Represents an authenticated wallet connection, including wallet address, provider name, connection status, and session expiration
- **Network Information**: Represents the current blockchain network, including chain ID, network name, and RPC endpoints
- **Connection State**: Represents the current state of the WalletConnect/Reown connection, including pairing status, QR code data, and deep link URIs
- **User Account**: Represents the connected wallet account, including address, balance (optional), and ENS name (if available)
- **Session Storage**: Represents persistent session data for maintaining authentication across page refreshes
