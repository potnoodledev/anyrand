# Feature Specification: Anyrand Frontend Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-frontend`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "build a frontend application for the underlying anyrand contracts. allow the user to login with a wallet and request randomness and fulfill pending requests. also show details about the previously done randomness request transactions and the resulting randomness"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A crypto user visits the Anyrand frontend application to interact with verifiable randomness services. They connect their wallet, view their transaction history, request new randomness for their applications, and optionally fulfill pending randomness requests from other users to earn fees. The interface provides clear visibility into the randomness generation process, transaction status, and historical results.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the application without a connected wallet, **When** they click "Connect Wallet", **Then** they can successfully authenticate using their preferred wallet and see their account dashboard
2. **Given** a connected user wants randomness, **When** they configure deadline and gas settings and submit a request, **Then** the system creates a randomness request and shows the pending status with estimated fulfillment time
3. **Given** a user has submitted a randomness request, **When** the deadline passes and the drand round becomes available, **Then** they can view the fulfillable status and either wait for fulfillment or fulfill it themselves
4. **Given** a randomness request has been fulfilled, **When** the user views their transaction history, **Then** they can see the original request details, fulfillment transaction, and the resulting random value
5. **Given** a user wants to earn fees by fulfilling requests, **When** they browse pending requests from other users, **Then** they can select and fulfill requests that have passed their deadline
6. **Given** a user's transaction is pending, **When** they check the status, **Then** they see real-time updates on transaction confirmation and estimated completion time

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a wallet connection is lost during transaction submission?
- How does the system handle failed randomness requests or callback failures?
- What occurs when a user tries to fulfill a request that has already been fulfilled by someone else?
- How are network congestion delays and high gas prices communicated to users?
- What happens when a user's wallet doesn't have sufficient funds for gas fees?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to connect their cryptocurrency wallet using standard wallet connection protocols
- **FR-002**: System MUST display the user's connected wallet address and current network

- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to submit randomness requests to the Anyrand smart contract
- **FR-006**: System MUST display real-time status updates for submitted randomness requests (pending, fulfillable, fulfilled, failed)
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to view a complete history of their randomness request transactions
- **FR-008**: System MUST display detailed information for each randomness request including request ID, deadline, gas settings, fees paid, and resulting random value
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to browse pending randomness requests from other users that are eligible for fulfillment
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to fulfill pending randomness requests to earn fulfillment fees
- **FR-011**: System MUST show estimated earnings for fulfilling each pending request
- **FR-012**: Users MUST be able to view transaction confirmations and blockchain explorer links
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide clear error messages and suggested actions when transactions fail
- **FR-014**: System MUST display current network gas prices and estimated transaction times
- **FR-015**: System MUST show the user's transaction history with filtering and sorting capabilities
- **FR-016**: System MUST display the current drand beacon round and timing information
- **FR-017**: Users MUST be able to disconnect their wallet and switch to different wallets

- **FR-019**: System MUST display loading states and progress indicators for all blockchain interactions
- **FR-020**: System MUST show the verification status and randomness derivation for fulfilled requests

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Randomness Request**: Represents a user's request for verifiable randomness, including request ID, requester address, deadline, callback gas limit, fees paid, current status, and resulting random value
- **Transaction**: Represents blockchain transactions related to randomness requests and fulfillments, including transaction hash, block number, gas used, and confirmation status
- **User Session**: Represents a connected wallet session, including wallet address, network information, and connection status
- **Pending Request**: Represents randomness requests from other users that are available for fulfillment, including potential earnings and fulfillment requirements
- **Drand Round**: Represents the current state of the drand beacon, including round number, timestamp, and availability status
