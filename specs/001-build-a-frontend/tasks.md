# Tasks: Anyrand Frontend Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-a-frontend/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies

### Critical Dependencies (TDD)
- Tests (T004-T020) MUST complete before ANY implementation (T021-T070)
- All failing tests must be verified before proceeding to implementation

### Setup Dependencies
- T001-T003 (setup) must complete before all other tasks
- T021-T024 (configuration) must complete before hooks and components

### Implementation Dependencies
- Core types (T025-T028) before hooks (T032-T038)
- Base UI components (T039-T044) before feature components (T045-T054)
- Hooks (T032-T038) before components that use them (T045-T054)
- Components before pages and containers (T055-T058)

### Integration Dependencies
- Core implementation (T021-T058) before integration (T059-T070)
- Error handling (T068-T070) before polish phase

### Polish Dependencies
- All implementation and integration before polish (T071-T086)

```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- Verify ALL tests fail before implementing ANY functionality (constitutional requirement)
- Commit after each task completion
- Each task specifies exact file path for implementation
- Follow TDD strictly: Tests → Implementation → Integration → Polish

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**: 3 interface files → 17 test tasks (component, hook, blockchain interfaces)
2. **From Data Model**: 5 entities → 5 type definition tasks + corresponding hook tasks
3. **From User Stories**: 6 acceptance scenarios → 6 integration tests + 3 E2E test scenarios
4. **From Quickstart**: Testing scenarios → validation tasks in polish phase

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before task execution*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (component, hook, blockchain interfaces)
- [x] All entities have model/type tasks (RandomnessRequest, Transaction, UserSession, PendingRequest, DrandRound)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (TDD phases clearly separated)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files, no shared dependencies)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path (frontend/src/..., frontend/tests/...)
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task (verified no conflicts)

**Total Tasks**: 86 tasks organized in strict TDD order with comprehensive parallel execution opportunities.
