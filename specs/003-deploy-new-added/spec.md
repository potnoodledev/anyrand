# Feature Specification: Deploy LottoPGF Contracts

**Feature Branch**: `003-deploy-new-added`
**Created**: 2025-01-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "deploy new added lottopgf contracts found in contracts/lottopgf, by using the scripts in scripts/lottopgf. new files are copied over from a previous project and we may need to fix paths and update contract addresses to support our own deployed anyrand. final output is to update the quickstartLocal and quickstartScrollSepolia scripts to not only deploy anyrand but also deploy lottopgf"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Deploy LottoPGF contracts alongside Anyrand
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: LottoPGF contracts, deployment scripts, quickstart integration
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Marked configuration parameters and dependencies
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Defined deployment and verification scenarios
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable and deployment-focused
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ LottoPGF contracts, deployment scripts, quickstart processes
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Ready for implementation planning
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to deploy LottoPGF contracts alongside Anyrand contracts using a single command so that both systems are properly configured and integrated with each other for development and production environments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a clean local development environment, **When** I run the quickstartLocal script, **Then** both Anyrand and LottoPGF contracts are deployed and configured to work together
2. **Given** a Scroll Sepolia testnet connection, **When** I run the quickstartScrollSepolia script, **Then** both Anyrand and LottoPGF contracts are deployed to testnet with proper configuration
3. **Given** LottoPGF contracts from a previous project, **When** they are deployed, **Then** they correctly reference the newly deployed Anyrand contract addresses
4. **Given** deployment scripts with outdated paths, **When** the scripts are executed, **Then** they resolve to the correct contract and script locations in the current project structure

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Anyrand deployment fails but LottoPGF tries to deploy?
- How does the system handle network interruptions during sequential deployments?
- What happens if LottoPGF contracts reference non-existent Anyrand addresses?
- How are deployment failures rolled back to maintain consistency?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST deploy LottoPGF contracts from contracts/lottopgf directory
- **FR-002**: System MUST execute LottoPGF deployment using scripts in scripts/lottopgf directory
- **FR-003**: System MUST update contract references to use deployed Anyrand addresses instead of hardcoded addresses from the previous project
- **FR-004**: System MUST integrate LottoPGF deployment into quickstartLocal script for local development
- **FR-005**: System MUST integrate LottoPGF deployment into quickstartScrollSepolia script for testnet deployment
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure Anyrand contracts are deployed before LottoPGF contracts (dependency order)
- **FR-007**: System MUST update import paths and references to match current project structure
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide deployment verification for both contract systems
- **FR-009**: System MUST output deployed contract addresses for both Anyrand and LottoPGF
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific LottoPGF configuration parameters - lottery duration, ticket price, beneficiary settings?]

### Key Entities
- **LottoPGF Contracts**: Smart contracts for lottery-based public goods funding that depend on Anyrand for randomness
- **Deployment Scripts**: Automation scripts that handle contract compilation, deployment, and configuration
- **Quickstart Processes**: Combined deployment workflows that set up both Anyrand and LottoPGF systems in sequence
- **Contract Dependencies**: Relationships where LottoPGF contracts reference Anyrand addresses for random number generation
