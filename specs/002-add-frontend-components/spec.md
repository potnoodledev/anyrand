# Feature Specification: Anyrand Contract Interaction Components

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-frontend-components`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add frontend components to interact with the anyrand contracts given in the .env file, allow the user to request and fulfill randomness and view previous randomness requests on the contract from other users"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A connected wallet user accesses the Anyrand application to interact with deployed smart contracts. They can request verifiable randomness by submitting a transaction with appropriate fees, fulfill pending randomness requests if they are eligible operators, and browse historical randomness requests and fulfillments from all users to understand network activity and verify the integrity of the randomness generation process.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a connected wallet with sufficient balance, **When** they submit a randomness request with valid parameters, **Then** the transaction is sent to the contract and they receive a request ID for tracking
2. **Given** a user has submitted a randomness request, **When** the request is fulfilled by an operator, **Then** the user can view the generated randomness value and fulfillment details
3. **Given** there are pending randomness requests on the contract, **When** an eligible operator views the requests list, **Then** they can select and fulfill requests to earn fees
4. **Given** multiple users have made randomness requests over time, **When** any user views the history section, **Then** they can see all historical requests with their statuses, randomness values, and timestamps
5. **Given** a user wants to understand network activity, **When** they view the requests dashboard, **Then** they can see statistics like total requests, pending requests, and recent activity
6. **Given** a user attempts to make a request without sufficient funds, **When** they submit the transaction, **Then** they receive a clear error message about insufficient balance
7. **Given** a user's randomness request has been pending for an extended time, **When** they check their request status, **Then** they can see the current state and estimated fulfillment time

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user submits a randomness request with invalid parameters (deadline too short, callback gas too low)?
- How does the system handle network congestion that delays request fulfillment?
- What occurs when a fulfillment transaction fails due to gas estimation errors?
- How are failed callback executions displayed to users?
- What happens when a user tries to fulfill a request they are not eligible for?
- How does the system handle viewing requests on chains where contracts are not deployed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a form for users to submit randomness requests with deadline and callback gas limit parameters
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate user input for randomness requests before transaction submission
- **FR-003**: System MUST show real-time cost estimation for randomness requests based on current gas prices
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to view all their submitted randomness requests with current status
- **FR-005**: System MUST display a list of pending randomness requests available for fulfillment
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow eligible users to fulfill pending randomness requests
- **FR-007**: System MUST show detailed information for each randomness request including requester, parameters, and timestamps
- **FR-008**: System MUST display historical randomness requests from all users with pagination
- **FR-009**: System MUST show generated randomness values and fulfillment details for completed requests
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide transaction links to block explorers for all contract interactions
- **FR-011**: System MUST display clear loading states during transaction processing
- **FR-012**: System MUST show error messages when transactions fail with specific failure reasons
- **FR-013**: System MUST refresh data automatically when new blocks are mined
- **FR-014**: System MUST filter requests and fulfillments by wallet address, status, or time period
- **FR-015**: System MUST show network statistics including total requests, success rates, and average fulfillment times
- **FR-016**: System MUST prevent users from submitting invalid requests (deadlines in the past, gas limits too low)
- **FR-017**: System MUST display fee information and operator rewards for fulfilled requests
- **FR-018**: System MUST handle multiple contract deployments across different networks
- **FR-019**: System MUST show appropriate messages when contracts are not deployed on the current network
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide tooltips and help text for complex contract parameters

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Randomness Request**: Represents a user's request for verifiable randomness, including requester address, deadline, callback gas limit, fee paid, current status, and associated transaction hash
- **Randomness Fulfillment**: Represents the completion of a randomness request, including the generated randomness value, operator address, callback success status, actual gas used, and fulfillment transaction hash
- **Request Status**: Represents the current state of a randomness request (nonexistent, pending, fulfilled, failed)
- **Network Statistics**: Represents aggregate data about randomness activity including total requests, pending count, success rate, and average fulfillment time
- **Transaction Data**: Represents blockchain transaction information including hash, block number, timestamp, gas used, and transaction status
- **User Activity**: Represents a user's interaction history with the randomness service including requests made, requests fulfilled, and fees earned
