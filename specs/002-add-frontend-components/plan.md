# Implementation Plan: Anyrand Contract Interaction Components

**Branch**: `002-add-frontend-components` | **Date**: 2025-09-22 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/paulgadi/Desktop/_cosmic_apps/anyrand/specs/002-add-frontend-components/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Build comprehensive frontend components for Anyrand smart contract interactions, including request submission forms, fulfillment interfaces, and historical data viewers. Use the existing Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Wagmi framework with Reown AppKit wallet integration to create React components that interact with deployed Anyrand contracts via environment variables.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.7.2 with Next.js 15.1.2 and React 19
**Primary Dependencies**: Wagmi 2.14.6, Viem 2.21.57, Reown AppKit 1.6.2, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS
**Storage**: Blockchain state via contract queries, local storage for UI preferences, cookies for SSR session persistence
**Testing**: Vitest for unit testing, React Testing Library for component testing, Playwright for E2E testing
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with MetaMask/WalletConnect support
**Project Type**: web - extends existing frontend/ structure
**Performance Goals**: <2s transaction submission, <1s data refresh, 60fps UI interactions
**Constraints**: Contract deployment dependent, gas estimation accuracy required, wallet compatibility across networks
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-network support (Scroll, Scroll Sepolia, localhost), pagination for historical data, real-time event listening

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Test-First Development ✅
- All new React components will have unit tests written before implementation
- Contract interaction hooks will have comprehensive test coverage
- Integration tests will validate complete user workflows
- End-to-end tests will verify transaction flows with test networks

### Code Quality Standards ✅
- TypeScript strict mode enforced with no `any` types
- React components follow established patterns with proper prop typing
- ESLint and Prettier formatting applied consistently
- Code reviews required with constitutional compliance verification

### Security-First Architecture ✅
- Wallet integration uses established Wagmi/Reown patterns
- Input validation on all user inputs before contract calls
- No private keys or sensitive data exposed in frontend
- HTTPS enforced for production deployment
- XSS protection through React's built-in escaping

### Performance Optimization ✅
- React components optimized with memoization where needed
- Bundle size monitored and optimized
- Efficient contract query patterns with proper caching
- Loading states and error boundaries for better UX

### User Experience Consistency ✅
- Consistent design patterns across all new components
- Clear error messages and loading states
- Responsive design for all devices
- Accessible interfaces following established patterns

**Status**: PASS - No constitutional violations identified

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - extending existing frontend/ directory structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
