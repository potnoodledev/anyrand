# Research: Anyrand Contract Interaction Components

**Date**: 2025-09-22
**Feature**: Contract interaction frontend components

## Technology Decisions

### Contract Interaction Patterns
**Decision**: Use Wagmi's useContractRead, useContractWrite, and useWatchContractEvent hooks
**Rationale**:
- Wagmi provides type-safe contract interactions with automatic ABI inference
- Built-in caching and error handling reduce boilerplate
- React hooks pattern aligns with existing codebase architecture
- Automatic re-fetching on block changes ensures data freshness

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct viem calls: More control but requires manual caching and state management
- Ethers.js: Older library, larger bundle size, less TypeScript-friendly

### Real-time Data Updates
**Decision**: Combine useWatchContractEvent for new events with periodic useContractRead polling
**Rationale**:
- Event watching captures real-time randomness requests and fulfillments
- Polling ensures data consistency if events are missed
- Configurable intervals balance freshness with performance
- Wagmi's built-in query invalidation prevents stale data

**Alternatives considered**:
- WebSocket connections to RPC: More complex setup, potential connection issues
- Only polling: Less responsive to new events
- Only events: Risk of missed events during network issues

### State Management for Contract Data
**Decision**: Use TanStack Query (React Query) with Wagmi integration for contract state
**Rationale**:
- Already integrated with Wagmi for automatic caching
- Background refetching and cache invalidation
- Optimistic updates for better UX during transactions
- Error and loading state management built-in

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux Toolkit Query: More complex setup for this use case
- Local React state: No caching or background updates
- Zustand: Good for client state but not ideal for server state

### Transaction Status Tracking
**Decision**: Use Wagmi's useWaitForTransaction with optimistic UI updates
**Rationale**:
- Tracks transaction from submission through confirmation
- Provides gas estimation and error handling
- Enables immediate UI feedback before blockchain confirmation
- Handles network-specific confirmation requirements

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual transaction polling: Requires custom retry logic
- Provider.waitForTransaction: Lower-level, less integrated with React

### Data Pagination and Filtering
**Decision**: Implement cursor-based pagination using block numbers and request IDs
**Rationale**:
- Block numbers provide stable pagination cursors
- Request IDs are sequential and enable efficient filtering
- Reduces load on RPC endpoints compared to fetching all data
- Enables real-time insertion of new requests without pagination issues

**Alternatives considered**:
- Offset-based pagination: Unstable with new data insertion
- Load all data: Not scalable for active networks
- Time-based pagination: Less precise than block-based

### Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Implement error boundaries with user-friendly error messages and retry mechanisms
**Rationale**:
- Contract revert reasons need translation to user-friendly messages
- Network errors require different handling than contract errors
- Retry logic for transient failures improves UX
- Error boundaries prevent UI crashes from blockchain issues

**Alternatives considered**:
- Global error handler: Less contextual error handling
- Basic try-catch: No retry logic or user-friendly messages
- Toast notifications only: Doesn't handle component-level errors

## Implementation Patterns

### Component Architecture
**Decision**: Container/Presentation pattern with custom hooks for contract logic
**Rationale**:
- Separates contract logic from UI rendering
- Custom hooks enable reuse across components
- Easier testing with separated concerns
- Follows existing codebase patterns

### Form Validation
**Decision**: Use React Hook Form with Zod schema validation
**Rationale**:
- Type-safe validation with TypeScript integration
- Efficient re-rendering for large forms
- Built-in error handling and field management
- Zod schemas can be reused for API validation

### Gas Estimation Display
**Decision**: Real-time gas estimation with fee breakdown and user warnings
**Rationale**:
- Users need transparent fee information before transactions
- Gas price volatility requires real-time updates
- Warning thresholds help prevent failed transactions
- Fee breakdown aids user understanding

## Security Considerations

### Input Sanitization
**Decision**: Validate all user inputs with Zod schemas before contract calls
**Rationale**:
- Prevents invalid data from reaching smart contracts
- Type-safe validation reduces runtime errors
- Client-side validation improves UX
- Schema reuse ensures consistency

### Transaction Safety
**Decision**: Implement transaction simulation before submission
**Rationale**:
- Catch revert reasons before spending gas
- Provide accurate gas estimates
- Warn users about potentially failing transactions
- Reduce failed transaction costs

## Performance Optimizations

### Bundle Size Management
**Decision**: Code splitting for contract interaction components with lazy loading
**Rationale**:
- Large ABI files and contract utilities increase bundle size
- Lazy loading improves initial page load time
- Users may not need all contract functionality immediately
- Webpack can optimize chunk loading

### Query Optimization
**Decision**: Batch contract calls where possible and implement aggressive caching
**Rationale**:
- Multiple contract reads can be batched for efficiency
- Cache contract configuration data (gas limits, etc.)
- Minimize RPC calls to improve performance
- Background refetching keeps data fresh

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
**Decision**: Test custom hooks with @testing-library/react-hooks and mock contract calls
**Rationale**:
- Isolated testing of contract interaction logic
- Predictable test results with mocked blockchain state
- Fast test execution without network dependencies
- Comprehensive coverage of edge cases

### Integration Testing
**Decision**: Use local test network (Hardhat) for integration tests
**Rationale**:
- Real contract interactions without mainnet costs
- Controlled environment for test scenarios
- Ability to test error conditions and edge cases
- Reproducible test state

### End-to-End Testing
**Decision**: Playwright with test wallet for complete user flows
**Rationale**:
- Tests complete user experience including wallet interactions
- Validates UI components with real transaction flows
- Catches integration issues between frontend and contracts
- Automated testing of multi-step workflows
